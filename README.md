# Unit 5 Public API Requests
 Using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
# Project title
Public API Requests

## Why?
I'm going to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

After building this project, I can demonstrate working with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling the data that will be returned from requests and displayed in an app.

## Motivation
My fifth project for the Team Treehouse Tech Degree in Full Stack JavaScript.

Communicating with APIs allows people to work with micro-services/vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. Utilities, games, info-graphics, and more can be built. There's also the opportunity to integrate, display, and analyze social media/large data sets without having to create and curate them alone.

### Features and Personalization
I’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

I'll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
